            My name is Donmari. I am happily married to Chris, and we have a 10 month old son, Christopher, but we call him by his nickname, Bokchoy. Interestingly enough, ‘Growing Bokchoy’ fits perfectly as we will see him grow throughout my blog posts.

            My blog is my open journal. I am sharing my personal struggle as a mom, and I want you to be as open minded as possible. We are all different in raising our children. I am raising my son this way, and I am very open in taking advice and learning from you. I want my blog to be a safe space to other moms, struggling or not. We have different battles we’re taking, so please bear with me as I go with you in this journey.
